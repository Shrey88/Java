you can specify a package name as part of the class name
when you are actually creating a new class.

select the folder under which you want to create the folder structure else it will create the folder structure
under the current selected folder.
for e.g. com.example.game
this will create a folder com --> under it example folder --> under it, it will create a game.java file.
